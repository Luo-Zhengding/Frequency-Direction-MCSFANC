## Highlights
1. We proposed the Frequency-Direction Aware Multichannel Selective Fixed-filter Active Noise Control (FD-MCSFANC) method, which incorporates both frequency and direction information of primary noises for accurate filter selection in the multichannel ANC (MCANC) system.
2. A CNN is designed to classify noises based on both frequency components and Direction-of-Arrival (DOA), with the combined classification results determining selected control filters. A joint loss function based on multi-task learning is utilized to implement end-to-end training of the CNN.
3. Numerical simulations show that the FD-MCSFANC method effectively attenuates noises with different frequencies and incident angles.
